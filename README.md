=============

For using this Software you need:
---------------------------------
-Apache Server
-MySql Server
-A way to run the Maven project
(We recommend XAMPP and Eclipse)

Installing the Sampledata:
-------------------------
The required files are found in /Sampledata.
-Extract the adPictures.zip into Skeleton\src\main\webapp\img\
-Import the ese.sql.zip into your MySql Database:
--Open the myphpAdmin control panel(when using XAMPP)
--Create a new Database with the name "ese"
--In that database go to import.
--Select the ese.sql.zip file to import.
--Make sure the code is set to "utf-8" and the Format to "SQL"
--Click on ok

You now have installed the Sampledata.

Sampleusers:
----------
We have created a sample user with which you can explore the Software.
Login: ese@ese.ch pw: eseese


In order to create the sampledata for the user ese@ese.ch we had to create some additional users:
Login: test1@user.ch  pw: testtest1
Login: test2@user.ch  pw: testtest2
Login: test3@user.ch  pw: testtest3

We recommend to use the ese@ese.ch user but you can login into one of the other users to see what effects your actions as user ese@ese.ch had on the other users.
